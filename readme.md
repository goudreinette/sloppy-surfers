## Sloppy Surfers

Subway Surfers has become an icon of the ultra-short attention span of this age.

TikTok, reels and mobile games make the previous generations of media look Zen in comparison.
Sloppy Surfers is a ‘backport’ of Subway Surfers for the generation that grew up with the DS, so they can enjoy modern brainrot in an alternate universe too.
